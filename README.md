# About

This repository serves as a prototype for demonstrating the fundamental concept of Client-Server Architecture in the context of a messaging system implemented using Java.

<sub> ****P.S.*** The project was completed under CSE438 (Data Communication) course offered by North South University.*<sub/>

## Client-Server Architecture

In this messaging prototype, we utilize the Client-Server Architecture to achieve the following objectives:

- **Scalability:** The architecture allows for easy scalability. Multiple clients can connect to a central server, enabling communication between users on different devices and locations.

- **Centralized Control:** The server acts as a centralized entity responsible for managing user connections, message routing, and ensuring data integrity.

- **Efficient Communication:** Client-Server Architecture facilitates efficient communication by handling tasks such as message queuing, broadcast messages, and user authentication.

- **Reliability:** With a dedicated server, the messaging system can be designed to be more reliable and robust. The server can implement features like message persistence and backup to ensure data integrity.

- **Security:** The architecture allows for the implementation of security measures at the server level, such as user authentication, access control, and encryption, enhancing the overall security of the messaging system.
